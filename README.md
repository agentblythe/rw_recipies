Chapter 1 Key Points
- Flutter is a software development toolkit from Google for building cross-platform apps using the Dart programming language.
- With Flutter, you can build a high-quality app that’s performant and looks great, very quickly.
- Flutter is for both new and experienced developers who want to start a mobile app with minimal overhead.
- Install the Flutter SDK and associated tools using instructions found at https://flutter.dev.
- The flutter doctor command helps you install and update your Flutter tools.

Chapter 2 Key Points
- Build a new app with flutter create.
- Use widgets to compose a screen with controls and layout.
- Use widget parameters for styling.
- A MaterialApp widget specifies the app, and Scaffold specifies the high-level structure of a given screen.
- State allows for interactive widgets.
- When state changes, you usually need to hot restart the app instead of hot reload. In some case, you may also need to rebuild and restart the app entirely.
- To get a sense of all the widget options available, the documentation at https://api.flutter.dev/ should be your starting point. In particular, the Material library https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/material-library.html and Widgets library https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/widgets-library.html will cover most of what you can put onscreen. Those pages list all the parameters, and often have in-browser interactive sections where you can experiment.
